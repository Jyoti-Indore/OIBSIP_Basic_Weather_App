# 🌦️ Command-Line Weather App

## 🔖 Oasis Infobyte Internship – Task 3

This project is part of my **3rd task** for the **Oasis Infobyte Internship Program**.  
I built a Python-based **Command-Line Weather App** that allows users to enter a **city name or ZIP code** and fetch real-time weather data like temperature (in °C and Kelvin), humidity, wind speed, and weather condition using the **OpenWeatherMap API**.

---

## 📌 Features

- 📍 User inputs city name or ZIP code
- 🔐 API integration using OpenWeatherMap
- 🌡️ Displays:
  - Temperature (°C and Kelvin)
  - Humidity (%)
  - Weather Condition (e.g., Clear Sky, Rain)
  - Wind Speed (m/s)
- 📦 Runs on Google Colab or Python terminal
- 🛡️ Input and error handling included

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Learned how to work with **APIs** using the `requests` library
- Understood how to structure and handle **JSON data**
- Practiced **error handling** (status code 401, 404, etc.)
- Gained experience in **command-line interactivity** in Python
- Deployed the app on **Google Colab** for better flexibility

## 📝 Setup Instructions

### 🔹 1. Clone the Repository (if on GitHub)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
cd weather-app
```
---
##  2. Install Required Library
pip install requests

In Google Colab: !pip install requests
---
## 🔹 3. Get Your OpenWeatherMap API Key
Go to https://openweathermap.org/api

Sign up and log in

Visit https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys

Copy your default API key or create a new one

It may take 5–10 minutes for the key to activate

---
And then run the code
---
## 📂 Files Included
weather_app.ipynb – Google Colab version (recommended)

weather_app.py – Python script version (optional)

README.md – Complete project documentation
